# k-Server-Problem
Implement the Work Function Algorithm and the Greedy Algorithm for the k-Server problem on graph metrics, evaluate and compare their performance on different inputs.


1. The structure of the project

	- requirement (three files given by the super smart professor)
	- solution

		- main.py   (the python file used to run the program)
		- graph.py  (the python file is the graph class file)
		- ksever.py (the python file is the ksever class file)
		- data      (including all graph files downloaded from repository)

			- graph8.mtx
			- graph18.mtx
			- graph23.mtx
			- graph36.mtx
			- graph45.mtx
			- graph47.mtx
			- graph50.mtx

	- report

		- report.md  (report source file written by Markdown)
		- report.pdf (generated pdf file)
		- images     (all the images used in the report)
    
2. How to run the program (More detailed steps in the experiment section of the report)

    1. Go to the solution folder
    2. run the command "python3 main.py"
    3. Follow what the program says
